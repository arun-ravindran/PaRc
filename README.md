PaRC explores the idea of mining existing software bugs and patches expressed in a natural language, to recommend patches for new bugs. It uses Manhattan LSTM to score the similarity between bugs and patches. Parc is currently targeted at the Linux kernel. It is written in Python using the Pytorch machine learning library. 

This is a work in progress.
